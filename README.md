<h2 align="center">Classification of Autism in MRI using CNNs</h2>

<h2 align="center">Introduction</h2>

MRI has been widely employed for the detection of different brain related illnesses, such as: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Alzheimer and Parkinson. Deep learning has been widely used for this purpose; however, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies.

<h2 align="center">Dataset</h2>

For this study, the dataset released by Yang et al. was used (click [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12421) to access the dataset and original paper). This dataset derives from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) where subjects are classified intro controls (healthy) and patients (suffering from autism). From 1025 MRIs, 537 correspond to healthy brains and 488 to patients. As reported by the authors, there are 873 male and 152 female participants. The dataset also includes 259 teenagers and 96 children. Among these MRIs, 312 have been obtained with the patient having their eyes closed, which has impact on which areas of the brain are activated.
